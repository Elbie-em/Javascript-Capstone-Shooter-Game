<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Description

> This is javascript capstone project built with the Phaser 3 Game Engine.During the development process two days where all about to understanding how the game engine works and design how the game should look. Time was spent creating several assets to achieve an exceptional design. The final days consisted of building the project in order to produce a fully functional space shooter game that has different features to allow players to enjoy game play.

### Built With
The Game was built with the following technologies:
* Javascript
* Phaser Game Engine
* HTML
* CSS
* Firebase
* Webpack
* Eslint
* Stylelint
* npm

## Procedual Design

The design process was a challenge I was up for. At the end of day two, I had partially mastered Phaser. The main things I focused on was how to handle the physics and motion frameworks it provides. I also managed to organise all my assets which I imported from different sources and modified to my liking.
On the third day I started building the project while keeping the following concepts in mind:

* MVP - Building the main functionality before going further in implementing additional features.
* I made sure that the build was deployable by enabling it to work locally and via a hosting service.
* Use coding partners that would make my code easy to read.
* The visual aspect of the game is subject to change, I made sure I met all functionality requirements I laid out before proceeding.

## Selection of Building Blocks

In a limited amount of time, I was able to collect all game assets required to make the game an exceptional product. The most challenging part was creating sprites from scratch. I am glad this was successful.

## Getting Started

### Prequesites
 * npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repo to your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/Elbie-em/Javascript-Capstone-Shooter-Game.git
```

## Usage

2. Migrate to the cloned repository directory
```
cd Javascript-Capstone-Shooter-Game
```

3. Install all the project dependencies

```
npm install
```

4. Run the game:

NB: This will open a new tab on your browser where you will see the game or visit *localhost:8080/public/dist* .
```
npm start
```

## Game Play

- There are four controls for moving the ship/player:
1. using the Up, Down, Left and Right arrow keys
  * Key Up is for moving upward
  * Key Down is for moving downward
  * Key Left is for moving backwards
  * Key Right is for moving fowards

2. Use the spacebar to shoot.

## To play the Game
When the game starts you will see a user form, enter your user name before you proceed.
Click the ```Proceed``` button to continue, avoiding this will not allow you to proceed to other game scenes.

Click the ```Start``` button to begin playing the game.

## Enemies and Points rewarded after destruction

- There are four enemies in this game
  * The Mother ship enemies which a a future generation alien ships need to be destroyed by firing surge amunition from your ship. The mother ships release babyships which you need to destroy with your ships surge ammunition. 
  * The third enemies are Asteriods,these chase your ship as soon as the reach a certain range. You can shoot them with your surge amunition.
  * The last enemies are UFO's that are also destroyed with your surge amunition.
- For each type of enemy, there are different points.

## Others Future Features

> As this project open source, there are a number of features you can add, some include:

- ADD LIVES
- ADD DIFFERENT LEVELS
- ADD SHIP SELECTION
- ADD THE ALIEN BASE STATION TO DESTROY
- ADD A STORE
